Brady: I acquired and cleaned the NASS corn dataset. To do this, I created two separate notebooks, one for dataset acquisition and the other for cleaning, and pushed them to github. I also made the updates to our project plan by creating a constraints and gaps section from the feedback we received. Finally, I contributed greatly to the status report by updating the timeline, creating the description, and updating some of our tasks and requirements.
