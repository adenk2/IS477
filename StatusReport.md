In your project repository, create a new file named StatusReport.md that contains:
*  An update on each of the tasks described on your project plan including references to specific artifacts in your repository (such as datasets, scripts, workflows, workflow diagrams, etc).
*  An updated timeline indicating the status of each task and when they will be completed.
*  A description of any changes to your project plan itself, in particular about your progress so far. Also include changes you made to your plan based on feedback you may have received for Milestone 2.
*  Each team member has to write a short summary of their contributions to the current milestone. Each team member should add and   commit their contribution summary themselves to the shared github repo.
