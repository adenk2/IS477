Overview: Describe the overall goal of your project.

Research Question(s): What is/are the question(s) you intend to address?

Team: Clearly define team member roles and responsibilities

Datasets: Identify and describe the datasets that you will use. You need to use at least two different datasets that need to be integrated. 

1) https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-summary-of-the-month?pageNum=1&pageSize=10&bbox=40.240,-88.368,39.992,-88.120
   The first dataset we will be using is the weather and climate of Champaign, Illinois from 1902 to present.
3) 

Timeline: Document the plan and timeline for implementing your project including who will complete each task.

Data lifecycle (cf. Module 1): Relate your project to one or more of the lifecycle models discussed in class.

Ethical data handling (cf. Module 2): Identification of all ethical, legal, or policy constraints and how they were addressed. This includes issues related to consent, privacy/confidentiality, copyright, licenses and terms of use.

Data collection and acquisition (cf. Module 3): Collection or acquisition of at least 2 different datasets from distinct trustworthy sources. Selected datasets should either have different access methods (e.g., APIs) or formats/schemas.

Storage and organization (cf. Modules 4-5): Select and describe a specific storage and organization strategy. This may include use of tabular, relational, or semi-structured models via filesystems or databases as well as filesystem structures and naming conventions.

Extraction and enrichment (cf. Module 6):

Data integration (cf. Module 7-8): Integration of datasets (Python/Pandas or SQL)

Data quality (cf. Module 9): Document data quality assessment results.

Data cleaning (cf. Module 10): Describe any data cleaning methods applied (e.g., missing values, outliers, syntactic or semantic cleaning)

Workflow automation and provenance (cf. Module 11-12): Provide an automated end-to-end workflow. 

Reproducibility and transparency (cf. Module 13):  Your project must provide sufficient information to allow someone else to reproduce your workflow and analysis. 

Metadata and data documentation (cf. Module 15): Metadata and data documentation to support discovery, understandability, and reuse.

Your plan must clearly address each of the requirements described above


Constraints: Describe any known constraints.

Gaps: Identify any known gaps or areas where you need additional input.
Your plan should anticipate later course topics even if you donâ€™t yet know all the details. It is expected that your plan will evolve over time.
